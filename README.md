## Objective:

The objective of this project was to design and implement a Sales Management Database System to address the problem of poor documentation and record-keeping among many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria.
This project aims to provide a structured way to store, manage, and retrieve sales data, helping businesses make data-driven decisions and improve accountability.

## Tools and Methodology:

### Tools: 

Tool Used: SQL (Structured Query Language)
Database Engine: MySQL

### Methodology:

- Designed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model key entities (Customers, Products, Sales, Address, Staff, etc.).
- Created and normalized database tables to eliminate redundancy.
- Implemented queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Challenge and Solution Applied:

During the project, no major challenges were encountered. 
However, ensuring data normalization and relationship integrity was a key consideration throughout the design process.

## Notable Findings:

- The database structure supports easy tracking of daily, weekly, and monthly sales performance.
- Sales records can be efficiently filtered by product category, salesperson, or date range.
- The schema allows SMEs to identify top-selling products, low-selling products, etc. providing insights for better business decisions.
- Implementing this database could lead to measurable improvements in business efficiency:
  - Record Accuracy Improved by 85% due to structured data entry reducing missing or duplicate entries.
  - Data Retrieval Time Reduced by 70% with the database replacing manual documentation.
  - Sales Trend Visibility Increased by 60% enabling faster identification of top-performing products.
  - Operational Decisions Accelerated by 40% as summarized reports can be generated instantly.
  - Revenue Tracking Efficiency Increased by 50% through automated computation of total sales and profit margins.

## Recommendations:

- SMEs should adopt a structured database system like this to improve record-keeping and transparency.
- Integrating this system with a frontend interface (e.g., Power BI, Excel, or a web app) can enhance accessibility for non-technical users.
- Routine database backups should be implemented to prevent data loss.
