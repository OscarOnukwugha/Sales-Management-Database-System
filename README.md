## Objective:

The primary goal of this analysis is to understand user behaviour, digital habits and consumption, and its impact on productivity, lifestyle, and reading behaviours across various demographics. The analysis is structured to achieve the following key questions:
[Social Media Questions](https://github.com/JoyIbe/Zefas-and-Data-Crunch-Challenge-Using-Figma-and-Power-BI/blob/4f35b3f9b5c4c9701ef55f35977ebedcb9cceea3/Social%20Media%20Questions.docx)

Data Structure: The dataset contained 40 Columns and 300,000 rows of data.

## Tools and Methodology:

### Tools: 

Figma: UI/UX design

Power Query: I used power query to restructure and shape data (segmenting 40 columns into different tables) for modeling to optimize performance speed.

Dax: I used Dax functionalities to develop new tables and generate measures for key metrics and custom visuals.

Power BI: To build the interactive dashboard.

### Method:

Data Cleaning: This data provided for this challenge was in a clean state but I performed various transformation in columns like
- Changing age to age group,
- Monthly income to Low monthly earners, Medium monthly earners and High monthly earners distribution,
- Tech Saviness Level to Very low, Low, High and Very High, etc
 
Data Processing: With Power Bi's Dax functionalities, I created calculated measures to show valuable metrics, customized and design visuals to aid clarity in understanding trends.

Data Modeling: Modeling this data allows for multiple tables with lesser column information to speed up processing time, reduce redundancy and increase efficiency.

Data Visualization: Built a two page interactive dashboards  to understand user behavior, optimize content strategies, and develop healthier digital consumption patterns, balancing the use of social media, entertainment, technology, cultivating more physical habits and prioritizing audience's well-being.

## Challenge and Solution Applied:
Age column had existing outliers, almost all under 18 ages had record of their occupation as professionals, retired, etc and their marital status as divorced, widowed,etc

A good example was UserID 822, Age: 13 years old, Occupation: Retired, Marital Status: Divorced and many others

### Solution applied: 
To address this, I identified all records under 18 as outliers, supported by their significantly lower count compared to other age groups. I then grouped these records with the 18-25 age bracket, as it is the closest and most reasonable category for such cases. This approach ensures data consistency and accuracy.

### Key Insights:
- The most popular content type is news, closely followed by movies and short videos.

- Excessive notifications contribute to social media fatigue, affecting user well-being.

- Highly tech-savvy users prefer Smart TVs and tablets.

- Smartphone and PC usage is balanced across different user categories.

- Tech-savvy users consume more educational content, whereas others prefer entertainment.

- Professionals have the highest reading engagement.
  
- Students and unemployed individuals also dedicate substantial time to reading.

- Single users read more compared to married or widowed individuals.
  

## Recommendations:

- Platform-Specific Marketing: The audience breakdown shows that advertisers should focus on TikTok and Instagram toward younger viewers and use Facebook and YouTube for reaching older demographics.
  
ii. Given the nearly equal preference for all platforms, advertising on multi-platform is important.

- Improving Digital Well-being: To reduce social media fatigue level, users should embrace using "Do Not Disturb" features more often.

- Content Strategy Optimization: The platforms should dedicate resources to develop short-form news content and interactive video features because users strongly favor these formats.
  
ii. Subscription services need to establish multiple pricing plans that target users from different income groups.

- Digital Literacy Improvement: Educational content promotion must focus specifically on users who lack technological sophistication.
  
- Enhancing User Experience via Internet Speed: Streaming platforms need to improve how they distribute content to users who experience slow internet speeds.

# Conclusion:

The dashboard system generates important data which helps users make decisions about user behaviors and digital content use as well as productivity levels and content participation metrics. The excessive screen time along with social media fatigue indicates people are too dependent on digital entertainment. Digital platforms need to establish entertainment-productivity equilibrium through demographic analysis for personalized user experiences.

Digital literacy along with mindful consumption and strategic content delivery emerges as essential elements for today's growing online engagement.
